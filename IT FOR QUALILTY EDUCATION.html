<p class="body-content"> IT has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn and promote quality education. 
    It can provide access to a vast amount of information, enable personalized learning, promote collaboration, improve assessment,
    and increase efficiency. However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed, such as the digital divide, technology integration, 
    and security. By addressing these challenges, we can ensure that IT is used to its full potential and that all students have access to quality education.

<p class="body-content">
    The United Nations understand the supremacy of education for a brighter and prosperous future and is therefore of the consensus that quality education 
    and not merely education should be a reality for all. In its Sustainable Development Goals, the UN has identified quality education as a major goal to 
    ensure the ‘transformation of the world’ by 2030. By quality education, the UN implies equitable and standard education for all that will promote lifelong 
    learning and the urge to gather knowledge. Inclusivity and equitability are the foundations to be upheld in quality education and not a greater literacy rate. 
    This is a revolutionary approach to understanding education and making it the means of changing the world..</p>
